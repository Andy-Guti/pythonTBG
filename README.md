# pythonTBG

## Welcome to my terminal dungeon crawler.
If you would like to play and try it out, all you have to do is pull the repo and run 'python3 Main.py' in your terminal. For best results, I recommend making your terminal as large as possible.


## Current Features
- Randomly generated dungeon floors that the player can traverse forever.
- Simple Enemies that can be defeated in random room.
- Randomly generated shops that the player can buy weapons from and also sell weapons to.

## Future Plans
See issues in repo
